A 9-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fever, cough, respiratory distress, and chest pain.
The patient had been well until 8 days before admission, when cough, red and watery eyes, and a temperature of 37.2°C developed. Two days later, on a winter holiday, he vomited and did not want to open his presents. The temperature rose to 38.9°C, and he became increasingly lethargic. The next day, he saw his pediatrician. On examination, the temperature was reportedly 39.4°C, the right periorbital region and cheek were erythematous, and a cervical lymph node on the left side was enlarged. A rapid screening test for streptococcal pharyngitis was negative; supportive care was advised, and the patient returned home.
The next day, 4 days before admission, shortness of breath and tachypnea developed. The patient was seen in the emergency department at another hospital, where a chest radiograph was reportedly normal. A diagnosis of acute otitis media was made, and a 5-day course of azithromycin was prescribed. During the next 3 days, cough and occasional vomiting persisted. On the morning of admission, he returned to his pediatrician. The patient and his family reported that he had worsening cough, midsternal chest pain with deep inspiration, and weight loss of 1.8 kg in 1 week. On examination, the temperature was 40.3°C, and he appeared to be in respiratory distress. Acetaminophen was administered, and he was sent to this hospital.
The patient's family reported decreased cervical lymphadenopathy in the patient as compared with earlier in the week; however, cough and shortness of breath had worsened. He did not have diarrhea, jaundice, rash, tongue or lip swelling, or abdominal or joint pain.
The patient had been delivered by cesarean section because of failure to progress after 42 weeks of uncomplicated gestation; umbilical-cord separation occurred in a normal time frame. Between the ages of 6 and 9 years, he had had five episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis, three episodes of otitis media, and four episodes of cellulitis (most recently, caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, sensitive to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole). One year earlier, he had been evaluated in the pulmonary clinic at this hospital because of a cough of 3 months' duration, which occurred during the day but not during sleep. At that time, the physical examination was normal. T-cell subsets were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1TABLE 1
Laboratory Data.
. Specific IgE antibodies to environmental allergens were not detected by immunoassays. Antibody titers to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine were not at protective levels. Pneumococcal vaccine was administered, with improvement in the antibody titers to protective levels. Spirometry was normal. Nasal fluticasone was administered for 1 month, without improvement, but the cough gradually resolved spontaneously.
The patient had attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, had had molluscum contagiosum in the past, and approximately 5 years earlier, had lymphopenia that had resolved spontaneously, with no clinical sequelae. He did not have a history of failure to thrive, night sweats, recurrent lower respiratory tract disease, or severe or unusual infections. Medications on admission included ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and azithromycin. Immunizations, including the influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, were current, but he had not received the seasonal influenza vaccine. He had no known allergies.
The patient lived with his parents, a sibling, two dogs (one with a newly diagnosed roundworm infection), a cat (less than 1 year of age), and a snake. His home was heated with forced hot water, and his parents had recently noted mold in the basement. The home had recently been sprayed with permethrin for eradication of lice. Moles had been seen in the backyard where the patient played. He had been exposed to relatives with pneumonia 1 month earlier. He had not traveled internationally or to the midwestern or southwestern United States. His father worked in construction, smoked in the home, and had recurrent skin abscesses. The patient's mother and sister were carriers of cystic fibrosis, a maternal aunt had environmental allergies, and a paternal aunt had rheumatoid arthritis. His parents were of western European ancestry, with no history of consanguinity.
On examination, the patient was alert and oriented. He appeared ill. The temperature was 38.6°C, the blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg, the pulse 109 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 32.3 kg. Conjunctival injection with edema (chemosis), mild erythema of the right upper cheek and the left tympanic membrane, dry mucous membranes, and a mildly enlarged and mobile nontender anterior cervical lymph node were present, and the trachea was midline. There was no nasal flaring or suprasternal retraction on inspiration, there were mild intercostal and subcostal retractions, and the abdomen protruded on inspiration. Air entry was good (with poor inspiratory effort because of chest pain), and there were coarse breath sounds, without crackles or wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal.
The platelet count and blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, glucose, total protein, globulin, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other test results are shown in Table 1. Rapid screening of a nasal swab for influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was testing for influenza A (seasonal and H1N1) nucleic acid. Urinalysis revealed clear amber fluid with 2+ albumin, 1+ urobilinogen, and 2+ bilirubin; 3 to 5 red cells, 5 to 10 white cells, and many bacteria per high-power field; 3 to 5 hyaline casts per low-power field; and mucin. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific T-wave changes in the inferior leads. A chest radiograph showed hilar lymphadenopathy and multiple nodular opacities throughout both lungs, more prominent in the middle and lower zones. Normal saline (a total of 1500 ml) was infused in three boluses. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained and remained sterile. Vancomycin was administered intravenously.
The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, and the administration of meropenem (intravenously) and azithromycin and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (orally) was added. Ten hours after presentation, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal ill-defined nodular opacities throughout all lung lobes, superimposed areas of consolidation, scattered ground-glass opacities, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
On the second day, ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a small pleural effusion on the right side and was otherwise normal. Ultrasound examination of the neck showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, more prominent on the right side; there was no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the neck. During the second night, while the patient was sleeping, oxygen saturation decreased to 58%, with cyanosis on examination; saturation improved with arousal and rose to 93 to 95% with the administration of oxygen (1 liter per minute by nasal cannula). The maximal temperature was 38.4°C. A chest radiograph was unchanged. A skin test for tuberculosis was negative at 48 hours. Other test results were pending.
On the third day, a diagnostic test was performed
