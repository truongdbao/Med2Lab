A five-month-old female presented with one-week history of cough, catarrh, and fever at a referral hospital where she was admitted and treated for pneumonia. On discharge after two weeks of treatment, signs of respiratory distress persisted. Recurrent and worsening dyspnea was observed over a two-month period with repeated admissions. When an ordered chest X-ray showed left upper lobe consolidation and collapse, patient was started on anti-Koch's therapy. Mantoux and erythrocyte sedimentation rate test results were 5 mm and 65 mm/hr, respectively, while tests for HIV I and II were negative. She had no history of contact with anyone with chronic cough or tuberculosis and vaccinations were up to date. There was no family history of asthma or atopy, but history of poor weight gain was present. Echocardiography ordered on account of persistent dyspnea showed a small secundum atrial septal defect which subsequently closed after 6 months.

Following 12 months of anti-Koch's therapy, an evaluation at the referral hospital revealed respiratory distress and persistent poor weight gain with weight of 8.5 kg at two years. Chest auscultation revealed widespread rhonchi and crepitations. There was no cyanosis and a repeat chest X-ray showed a hyperinflated right lung field with left upper lobe collapse and left mediastinal shift
